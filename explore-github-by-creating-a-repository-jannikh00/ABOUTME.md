## Introduction
I'm from Germany studying at Lourdes University in Ohio. Here I participate in the Men's Soccer team. I love the field of Computer Science because it has so much to offer and you learn new things everyday.

## Why I'm Interested In Coding
Coding is the basis of everything we do with computers. It's so interesting to see different programs etc. and to think about how they actually work on a code-level. My goal is to be able to produce code for such bigger, useful programs.
